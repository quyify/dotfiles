# Get the current branch name
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Get the parent branch using our parent-branch script
parent_branch=$(git-parent-branch)

# Find the common ancestor (merge base) between:
# - the parent branch (prefixed with origin/)
# - and the current HEAD
merge_base=$(git merge-base origin/$parent_branch HEAD)

# Show the diff between:
# - the merge base (where we branched from)
# - and the current state (HEAD)
# This shows all changes made in our branch
git diff $merge_base..HEAD

# Usage examples:
# diff-branch              - show diff
# diff-branch | pbcopy     - copy diff to clipboard (Mac)
# diff-branch | clip       - copy diff to clipboard (Windows)
# diff-branch | xclip      - copy diff to clipboard (Linux)
